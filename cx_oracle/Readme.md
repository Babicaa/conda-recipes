This package recipe was generated by:

```
conda skeleton pypi cx_oracle
```

Before executing this command, all ORACLE environment variables need to be unset!
Afterwards `oracle-instantclient` needs to be added as run and build dependency. Also build.sh need to be adapted - add `export ORACLE_HOME=$PREFIX/lib`
